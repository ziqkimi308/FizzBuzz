### FizzBuzz

- The FizzBuzz Generator is a simple Python program that generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100. For each number, it outputs:

- "Fizz" if the number is divisible by the first input number.
- "Buzz" if the number is divisible by the second input number.
- "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both input numbers.
- The number itself if it is divisible by neither.
- The program is customizable through user input for the first and second numbers, making it a dynamic FizzBuzz implementation.
